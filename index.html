      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>My name is Joshua Helton and I am a junior at Mississippi State University in Computer Engineering. This is my dissection project for Embedded Systems (ECE 4724) at Mississippi State during Spring of 2025.
      </p> The device that I chose is the Llano Laptop Fan. I chose this product because of my interest in motor and led control, as well as the circuit design of a product that I constanly use.</p>

      <h2>2. Market Analysis</h2>
      <h3>Product History</h3>
      <p>The Llano V10 is a high-performance laptop cooling pad designed to enhance thermal management for gaming and high-performance laptops. It features a powerful 4.72-inch external turbofan, adjustable stand, RGB lighting, and a 4-port USB hub. The V10 is suitable for laptops ranging from 13 to 17.3 inches in size.</p>

        <li>Other third-party marketplaces such as NewEgg and Ebay also carry this model. Also the official Llano website only carrys the newer V12 model.</li>

      </table>

      <h3>Comparable Products</h3>
      <p>There are many versions of laptop fans, however they usually do not hold up to the same standard of the Llano cooling pad. This is usually because they have weaker fan motors, no LEDs, or no insulating foam.</p>

                                         The EasyAcc speaker contains a variety of input/output devices to provide the user with a convenient experience:

                                     </ul>
                                 </div>
                             </div>
                             <div class="row mg-sm">

                                     The inputs to the speaker allow the user to supply a variety of audio sources and provide control over the playback of that audio.  
                                     The SPST switches respond to a single short press and to a single long press.  The switches have two markings – one on the switch surface and one on the plastic above the switch.  
                                     The assumed intention of the designers was that the marking on the switch surface designated a short-press action, and the marking on the plastic designated a long-press action.  
                                     However, there is an inconsistency with the markings because Switch 1 and Switch 2 follow the assumed intentions, but Switch 3 and Switch 4 have the markings reversed.  
                                     For a user, this is a confusing design flaw.  Switch 1 is used to select the operational mode of the device on a short press, and it begins the Bluetooth pairing sequence on a long press.  
                                     Switch 2 is used to toggle play and pause of the current audio on a short press, and it answers or hangs up a Bluetooth phone call if the device is in Bluetooth mode.  
                                     Switch 3 is used to skip to the previous track on a short press, and it decreases volume on a long press.  Switch 4 is used to skip to the next track on a short press, and it increases volume on a long press.  
                                     The SPDT switch is used to turn the device on and off.  The microphone is used to support Bluetooth phone calls.  
                                     From testing, this microphone has a range of approximately two feet before the person on the other end of the phone could not hear what was being said.  
                                     The SD card slot allows the user to play MP3 audio files from a memory card.  The Micro-USB port is multi-functional.  It charges the device and receives the line-in audio and serves as an FM radio antenna.  
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                     The outputs to the speaker revolve around transducing the audio signal to acoustic vibrations. The 3.5mm jack is used to drive headphones. 
                                     This is convenient for a user because the EasyAcc speaker can provide a greater drive strength than some smartphones, which allows the user to connect nicer headphones.  
                                     The speaker on the top of the device broadcasts the audio to the user.  
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    The Bluetooth module is an input and an output because it performs two-way communication with the paired device to stream audio and control the playback.  
                                     It also allows the user to receive phone calls on the EasyAcc speaker. 
                                 </p>

                                     The speaker appears to operate using a main application that handles audio playback and interrupts to process user input.  
                                     The application maintains a circular array of the four modes of operation, listed in order — Bluetooth, FM Radio, Line In, 
                                     and SD Card.  At power on, the device enters the SD Card mode if the memory card is present, otherwise it enters the Bluetooth mode.  
                                     The mode is changed when an interrupt is registered from a short press on Switch 1.  On this interrupt, the mode is incremented to 
                                     progress to the next sequential mode and it wraps around from SD Card to Bluetooth.  The only deviation from this ordering occurs when 
                                     an SD Card is inserted while the device is in any other mode.  The mode updates immediately to SD Card mode and begins playback.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                     The Bluetooth mode allows for wireless streaming of audio and phone calls from a remote device.  The Bluetooth communication is two-way, 
                                     which allows for media control on the source device from the speaker switches.  A short press on Switch 2 pauses or plays the media, and 
                                     a short press on Switch 3 or Switch 4 changes to the previous or next media track.  A long press on Switch 1 begins the Bluetooth pairing 
                                     process, and a long press on Switch 2 ends an in-progress phone call.  The volume is controlled with long presses on Switch 3 and Switch 4.  
                                     The Bluetooth mode is the default state unless a SD card is inserted.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                     The FM Radio mode plays audio from local radio stations.  Initially, this mode requires a scan of available radio stations in the area, 
                                     otherwise it just outputs static.  This scan must be performed with the device connected to a power source, and it begins when a long press 
                                     interrupt occurs from Switch 2.  Once this scan is performed once, the results are stored on the device, so this mode can be entered any 
                                     time.  The scan can be performed again to change the list of radio stations if the device is moved to a new area.  In this mode, Switch 3 
                                     and Switch 4 short presses go to the previous or next radio station in the list, and a Switch 2 short press mutes/unmutes the audio.  
                                     Switch 3 and Switch 4 long presses decrease/increase the volume.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                     The Line In mode plays audio from a connected auxiliary port.  The Micro-USB cable converts a 3.5mm jack to Micro-USB for input to the 
                                     speaker.  In this mode, a Switch 2 short press mutes the audio, but does not stop playback on the source device.  A long press on Switch 3 
                                     or Switch 4 decrements or increments the volume.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                     The SD Card mode plays audio from MP3 files stored on a removable SD card inserted in the device.  The media files are played on continuous 
                                     loop.  A short press on Switch 2 pauses or plays the audio, and a short press on Switch 3 or Switch 4 changes to the previous or next media 
                                     file on the memory card.  A long press on Switch 3 or Switch 4 decreases or increases the volume.  This mode takes highest priority over all 
                                     other modes.  If an SD card is inserted while the speaker is in another mode, the speaker changes to the SD Card mode and begins operation.  
                                     If an SD card is inserted at power on, the speaker begins in SD Card mode.  If the SD card is removed at any point while the speaker is in SD 
                                     Card mode, the speaker changes to Bluetooth mode.

                                             The image to the left shows the output from the JL chip that controls the LED.  The period that is high is the time that the LED is on.  
                                             The LED is a three-lead device to control color output.  Therefore, there are two pins on the JL chip to drive the two 'color' leads on 
                                             the LED.  The third lead is common reference.  The output from both JL pins is the same as shown, but only one pin is active at a time 
                                             depending on whether the LED is supposed to display red or blue.  The LED requires more current than the JL microcontroller can source or 
                                             sink, so the JL chip drives the base leg of a BJT which provides the current drive strength for the LED.

                                         the speaker can only handle frequencies up to about 90kHz.  The power source can be seen directly to the left of the oscilloscope and it shows the 3.7V 
                                         simulated battery output with the fluxuating current consumption.  The current consumption peaks at 530mA during playback at maximum volume.

                             <p>
                                 The image below shows a high level functional diagram for the EasyAcc speaker.  The speaker has 6 inputs, 3 outputs, and 1 two-way commmunication channel.  
                                 The core of the unit is the central microcontroller.

                             <h3>Electrical Characteristics</h3>
                             <p>
                                 The tables and images below describe the electrical characteristics of the EasyAcc speaker.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                                 The frequency response of the speaker is approximately 93Hz to 82kHz, based on the FFT taken during speaker playback. This response is adequate for a small portable speaker 
                                 but is not competitive with larger speaker systems, which can have responses below 10Hz to over 110kHz.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                                 The table below shows the electrical characteristics observed during testing.  The device specifications state that it can operate for 10 hours without requiring a recharge. 
                                 Based on the data collected, the device does not come close to meeting this specification when at maximum load.  However, the peak current was used to calculate the battery 
                                 life, which isn't accurate of the total consumption during operation.  At maximum volume, the current consumption fluctuates from 0.11A to 0.53A with the average being somewhere 
                                 around 0.22A.  Even at this rate, the speaker has a runtime of 2.25 hours, which does not meet it's runtime specification.  Also to note, the voltage drop that occurred at maximum 
                                 load is the result of using a 500mA-rated voltage regulator that begins to collapse.  The no-load simulated test showed a steady 0.01A current consumption, which would allow 
                                 the device to operate for five times the requirement.  The regulator has a minimum supply voltage of 2.75V before it enters shutdown.  The maximum supply voltage to the regulator 
                                 was not tested because it would most likely cause irreversible damage to the component, but this test could have been performed by increasing the supply voltage until the regulator 
                                 failed.
